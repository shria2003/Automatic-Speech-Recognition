# Automatic-Speech-Recognition

The project's main goal is to enhance the precision of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using deep learning methods. ASR plays a crucial role in various applications like voice assistants, transcription services, and speech-to-text systems. Despite progress, ASR systems still encounter difficulties in accurately recognizing speech due to factors such as background noise, accents, and variations in speech patterns. This research proposes employing deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to enhance ASR accuracy. Through extensive training on vast speech datasets, the project aims to create a robust ASR system capable of precisely transcribing speech across diverse conditions and contexts.
